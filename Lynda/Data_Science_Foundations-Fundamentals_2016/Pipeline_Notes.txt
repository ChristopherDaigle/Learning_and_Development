Four stages of Data Science Projects
1. Planning
2. Data Preparation
3. Modeling
4. Follow-up

Stage 1: Planning
1. Define goals
2. Organize resources
3. Coordinate people
4. Schedule Project

Stage 2: Data Preparation
1. Get data
2. Clean data
3. Explore data
4. Refine data

Stage 3: Modeling/Analysis
1. Create model
2. Validate model - is it accurate, is it general
3. Evaluate model - test accuracy and robustness
4. Refine model - tuning and implementability

Stage 4: Follow-up
1. Present the model
2. Deploy model
3. Revisit model
4. Archive assets
